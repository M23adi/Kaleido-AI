# 🌈 Kaleido: The Adaptive AI Tutor
> *Don't just learn it. Relate to it.*

Kaleido is an intelligent educational agent built for the **TechSprint Hackathon**. It solves the problem of "One-Size-Fits-All" education by dynamically restructuring complex topics to match the student's **Interests**, **Language**, and **Learning Style**.

## 🚀 The Problem
Students struggle with complex engineering concepts because:
1.  **Language Barriers:** Textbooks are often in high-level English.
2.  **Lack of Engagement:** Abstract concepts feel disconnected from real life.
3.  **Rigid Formats:** Visual learners are forced to read long text.

## 💡 The Solution
Kaleido uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** to act as a "Contextual Translation Engine."
* **For the Cricket Lover:** Explain "Digestion" using "Bowling Yorkers."
* **For the Visual Learner:** Instantly generate **Flowcharts** using Graphviz.
* **For the Rural Student:** Explain "Cloud Computing" using "Water Storage" analogies in Hinglish.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Brain:** Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python)
* **Visualization:** Graphviz (Diagrams as Code)
